What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
the current directory becomes a repositotry after
running the git init. We need to do this
to track commits and probably there's
required implications with plugins
running programs.

How is the staging area different from
the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
staging area is the area where commits to be
reside. repository tracks the commits made
after they go through staging area and the 
working directory is the directory within
the repostitory that is being currently
worked on
