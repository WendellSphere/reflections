When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You wold use a remote repositroy if you're not on your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Not sure.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
forks are clones that operate soley on git hub in order to give credit 
to the original creator. Clone is to copy a whole repostory from gitHub 
unto git on a local device. Branches streams of commits that 
are pushed or pulled or cloned.
