Git commands (for this lesson)
& reflection prompts

git remote add orgin url   //adds remote repostory named orgin
git remote -v		// checks url was added correctly
git push orgin master (remote name, local branch name) // 
git pull orgin master ""  //

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You wold use a remote repositroy if you're not on your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Not sure.
